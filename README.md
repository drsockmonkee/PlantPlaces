Working on a java website.

I'm working on 'Evolving' as a coder.  I do not have a Computer Science degree and have learned most of everything I have either through self study or through training courses I have taken through my different employers.

I came upon the series of videos I am working through given by Mr Jones (listed as a professor at the University of Cincinati) and have been working through them.

I encourage anyone who wants to gain a greater understanding of building a complete end to end application to watch and work through the examples that Mr. Jones has posted.
